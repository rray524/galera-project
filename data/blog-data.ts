      "Traveling domestically via public transportation in a foreign country may seem daunting at first, but it is relatively easy to use public transport in the Philippines as most Filipinos speak English fluently. The country has an extensive network of public transport options comprised of domestic flights, rail, buses, taxis, and especially ferries, since the Philippines is made up of more than 7,000 islands. Public transportation in the Philippines is mostly reliable, although it can seem a little chaotic for most Westerners.",

      "The Scuba Place visited Scandi Divers in Puerto Galera Philippines hosting a group of divers. This is their trip report from their visit in April 2023.The question I am asked most often is of course, What is your favourite dive destination? I have tried to be smart and answer with a number of responses encapsulating types of diving, such as wreck, big marine life, liveaboard etc, but in truth, I have never really known the actual answer. I have favourite dives of course, but not necessarily a favourite destination.",
